## Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction — Python

### 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


### 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data to identify key factors influencing customer attrition and builds a machine learning model to predict churn.



### 📂 Dataset
- Telecom customer churn dataset with customer demographics, services, and billing information.



### 🛠️ Key Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (type conversion, missing value handling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Built a Logistic Regression model for churn prediction
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score



### 📈 Model Performance
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~78%
- Strong performance in identifying non-churn customers



### 🎯 Outcome
Identified important churn drivers such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges, providing actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
